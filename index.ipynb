    "As the organization considers expanding into aerospace operations, a clear understanding of patterns in accident frequency and severity is critical for minimizing operational risk.This project analyzes historical aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to support data-driven aircraft procurement decisions.  \n",
    "Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, this notebook identifies aircraft characteristics and operational factors associated with safer outcomes. The findings are used to develop practical recommendations to guide aircraft selection and risk management strategy.\n",

    "The company is considering entry into the aviation market by purchasing and operating aircraft. To support procurement decisions, the aim is to analyze historical aviation accident data to identify aircraft that are associated with lower operational risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Business Objective**\n",
    "Identify aircraft that are associated with lower accident risk and severity, or good durability, in order to guide safer aircraft acquisition and operational planning.\n",

    "##### **Key Business Questions**\n",
    "The following are the key questions this analysis attempts to answer as they would directly inform procurement decisions:    \n",
    "\n",
    "*   How has accident risk changed over time?  \n",
    "*   Which aircraft or aircraft types are more prone to accidents?  \n",
    "*   Which aircraft provide the most safety and are the most durable in accidents?  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Success Criteria**\n",
    "The aforementioned questions will be considered as well answered by three data-backed procurement recommendations with visual/graphical evidence as support."
